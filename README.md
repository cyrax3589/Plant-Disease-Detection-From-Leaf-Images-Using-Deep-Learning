## Overview

**L.E.A.F.I.X.** is a cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) application designed to combat agricultural loss by providing instant, highly accurate plant disease diagnostics. 

By leveraging transfer learning via `MobileNetV2` and wrapping the inference engine in a highly customized, non-scrolling Streamlit dashboard, L.E.A.F.I.X. bridges the gap between complex machine learning models and end-user accessibility. It not only predicts the disease but immediately suggests probable, actionable agronomic treatments.

## Key Features

### Model Capabilities
- [x] **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuned `MobileNetV2` base model pre-trained on ImageNet.
- [x] **Robust Generalization:** Extensive preprocessing and image augmentation (rotation, zooming, flipping) to prevent overfitting.
- [x] **Multi-Class Classification:** Capable of differentiating between multiple disease states and healthy control leaves across various plant species.
